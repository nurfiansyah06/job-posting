### What you need to consider
- What if there are thousands of jobs in database?
To handle a large number of jobs in database, I would first implement using pagination to retreive jobs in smaller.
Next, I will optimize query sql with indexing. Indexes can speed up queries.
Additionally, Iâ€™d consider caching frequently accessed queries using a system like Redis to reduce database load.

- What if many users are accessing your API at same time?
To handle multiple users accesing an API, I would implement rate limiting in the system and if the system have high traffic
I would implement using load balancer, load balancer can help to distribute load across multiple server
